readme.txt for the Pong chu book examples code.

The example listing from the Pong chu books are listed in this project folder.  It is advised that the user go conconcurrently go through the book reading in order to gain the understanding needed properly implement the examples and learn for your own HDL development.  

Notes on the code listings:
* Not all of the listing are intended to be run on the FPGA.  These listings are used as reference code in the book.  The user can build the code if they like, but they will need to add the proper UCF and any additional logic to do anything useful with these listings.  
* The examples that are intended to be run on the FPGA have a seperate directory with the xilinx *.xise project file.  The user can simply double click this file and the project with referenced listing code will be opened in ISE webpack.  The user can then synthesize and create a bit file to run on the FPGA.
  - Once the bitfiles are created the user will need to load them onto the FPGA as specifiied in the corresponding quick start guide as found the LOGI wiki @ wiki.valentfx.com.
* In some cases there were modifications to the exmaple projects, based on using a differnet board from the original board used in the book.  Notes are listed in teh listing page that describe any differences in the modified example code.
